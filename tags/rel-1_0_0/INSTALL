3. Add the following within the "Rails::Initializer.run do |config|" block in config/environment.rb

    config.plugins = ["engines", "*"]

4. The EXT Toolbawks provides a core stylesheets and in addition to several javascript files, so you'll 
   need to include these two lines within your application's layout. Add the following lines:

  <%= javascript_include_tag 'prototype', 'effects' %>
  <%= javascript_include_tag 'adapter/prototype/ext-prototype-adapter', 'ext-all', :plugin => 'toolbawks_extjs' %>
